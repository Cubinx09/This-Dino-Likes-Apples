# This Dino Likes Apples
Sixth Project for the Athena Awards. Very last one too. Ended off with a bang I say.

Unlike all other projects I have done for this hackathon, this one is entirely made in Godot! I find game design more interesting that web development wither way. Anyways, this game is a very quick platformer about a dinosaur traveling across 3 levels to get the biggest apple of them all. Why? Because they're a fan of apples, obviously.

On the topic of challenges, learning a whole new engine is definetely the first one. Although, GDScript acts a lot like HTML so the transition wasn't that hard, and the user interface was all very easy to digest. But since it's a game engine I have no clue how to use, I had to do some studying, which normally meant darting around different sections of videos to find how to do a thing, and then translating said knowledge into my game. Mostly Brackey's 1 hour long Godot tutorial. I'll say the most time consuming part of the project was making all the scripts work. I tried to make to make the doors in the game automatically send you to the next level, but I then just made it that you have to manually do it because the coding for that is easier, albeit not at all optimal. Had to duplicate doors. 

I modeled all the levels based on my liking and also made them a bit easy because if I tried to add more difficulty, the game would actually be bad. But to me this seems like a breeze.

There's no audio because I wanted to focus more on visuals and player feedback in movement, and I also wanted to use my own sounds if it came to audio, but im not good at making music of sfx so that goal has to wait.

The doors and the apple are sprites that I've made, but the Character assets used come from Dino Character Sprites (you can find this asset pack on itch.io) by @ArksDigital on twitter. Enemy sprites come from Rotten Pixels (they have their own website for this I'm pretty sure), and the enviroment assets come from Kevin's Mom House (asset pack can be found on itch.io).

Over the course of pretty much a month, watching tutorials, making this game, and other things, this took a lot out of me! In the end the project time total is a little over 15 hours! But I had a load of fun.
